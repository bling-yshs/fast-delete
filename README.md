# fast-delete-rs

## Introduction

This is a Rust program that can quickly delete files and folders using [fs_extra](https://docs.rs/fs_extra/latest/fs_extra/).

## Usage

You need to download it from the releases. Then, you must add it to the registry. I have included an example .reg file in this repository.
